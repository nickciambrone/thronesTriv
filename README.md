# thronesTriv
Project deployed at http://www.gameofthronestrivia.com/
This project is a visually appealing trivia game that tests the user's knowledge on a wildly popular TV show, Game of Thrones.
The user is asked an appropriatley difficult question, and is then shown a clip from the show, which shows the answer to the question. It is both entertaining and (fantasy) entertaining. The site was developed and is maintained solely by myself, Nicholas Ciambrone.
